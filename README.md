### Who made this?

We are a ragtag bunch of software developers and web developers, who are gamers at heart.  

We decided to make this game, because it seems like a nice idea for people who enjoy playing videogames, but might not be able to use their hands for whatever reason.  

Also, it seems like a cool skill to learn, to know how to program voice-activated things.

## Contributing

I welcome any pull requestions people might have for additional snippets.

I would love to support more languages as well.

## How To Test
The hardware that we used to test this is the Amazon Echo. But you can also use the Amazon Echo Dot or Amazon Tap, or you can use the testing tool, or https://echosim.io/ to run the tests.  

Please start the game by saying either of these:
- "Alexa, play 'Choose Your Own Adventure'."
- "Alexa, play 'Choose My Own Adventure'."
- "Alexa, ask 'Choose Your Own Adventure' to start."
